<h4>Software, scaling & cost of capital ðŸ¤“</h4>

Most recently, I worked at the [Ethereum Foundation][ef-link] with a focus on R&D ([grants][grants-link], ecosystem strategy and economics research).
Previously, I worked on [storage infrastructure][magic-pocket] and product engineering at Dropbox. 
Before that, I helped restructure corporate and soverign debt at [Lazard Freres][lazard-link] in New York. 
I studied alternative investments and behavioral economics while getting my economics degree at Harvard.

Currently, I am advising & investing part-time while taking some time to figure out what's next.

Here are some of the recent talks that I gave: [Beyond Blocks, July 2018][beyond-blocks], more coming soon.

Fun facts: I like to play racquet sports and [nosedive surfboards][nosedive-link]. 
I've lived in 9 cities, and love eating spicy food.

Currently reading: [Thinking in Bets][thinking-in-bets-link]. Accidental Superpower.
Recently read: [The Courage to be Disliked][courage-link].
