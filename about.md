<h3>Software, scaling & cost of capital.</h3>

Most recently, I worked at the [Ethereum Foundation][ef-link] with a focus on R&D ([grants][grants-link], ecosystem strategy and economics research).
Previously, I worked on [storage infrastructure][magic-pocket] and product engineering at Dropbox.
Before that, I helped restructure corporate and soverign debt at [Lazard Freres][lazard-link] in New York.
I studied alternative investments and behavioral economics while getting my economics degree at Harvard.

Here are some of the recent talks that I gave: [Beyond Blocks, July 2018][beyond-blocks].

I've lived in 9 cities, and am currently in California.
